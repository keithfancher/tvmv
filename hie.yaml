# Dear Future-Self,
#
# For a simple project like this one, this file shouldn't be necessary,
# allegedly. But without it, the language server will randomly poop out and
# spit out crazy errors about GHC versions. See this reddit thread for more
# context:
#
# https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/yr09pb/hls_stack_bizarre_redherring_error_about_ghcide/
#
# Also, if this file exists at all, we should (allegedly!) be able to specify
# an even simpler form of it, i.e. just:
# ```
# cradle:
#   stack:
# ```
# ...but this causes issues with the HLS as well, prevents it from finding
# dependencies in the `test` component.
#
# See https://github.com/haskell/hie-bios for more instructions on how to use
# this file. (There is also https://hackage.haskell.org/package/implicit-hie to
# auto-gen the file, but it generated incorrect results for me so I had to do
# it manually.)
#
# Anyway, assuming you don't add any more components, this shouldn't have to
# change.
#
# Love,
# Past-Self
cradle:
  stack:
    - path: "./src"
      component: "tvmv:lib"

    - path: "./app"
      component: "tvmv:exe:tvmv"

    - path: "./test"
      component: "tvmv:test:tvmv-test"
