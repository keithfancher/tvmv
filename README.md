# tvmv

A work in progress!

In the not-too-distant future it will be a minimal, hopefully-easy-to-use,
rename-tv-episode-files-in-bulk type of thing. Sort of like FileBot... but
without most of its features, without its half-broken java GUI, and certainly
without its (recurring?!) price tag.

Currently integrates with TheMovieDB.

See `PLAN.md` for the basic idea of what it *will* be once it's finished.
