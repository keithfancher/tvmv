  `s01e04` rather than `1x04`.) Some version of this is recommended by both
  [Plex](https://support.plex.tv/articles/naming-and-organizing-your-tv-show-files/#toc-0)
  and
  [Kodi](https://kodi.wiki/view/Naming_video_files/Episodes#Single_Episode_Files).


## 0.1.0 - 2023-01-19

### Added

- Everything! First complete release. See `README.md` for more details about
  its various features, &c.
